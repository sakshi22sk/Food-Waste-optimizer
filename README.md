# Food Waste Optimizer

## Abstract

Food prediction is influenced by several factors such as population density, education level, and the mean salary of a particular area. This predictive model is designed to study and analyze these variables to forecast potential food demand. It leverages regression analysis and clustering methods to identify correlations between geographic density metrics and dietary choices.

Our system employs graph-based algorithms and shortest path analysis to optimize the transportation of food, ensuring the lowest cost, shortest distance, and quicker delivery times. Moreover, it minimizes food waste by regulating surplus food from various parts of the city and redistributing it to the homes of poor and needy individuals.

Not only serves in transporting but anyone from this portal can donate food in real time. There is an additional admin portal through which the invitations are accepted or rejected hence it is a fully functional and useful project.
The ultimate goal of this project is to combat hunger and provide adequate nourishment to everyone, creating a more efficient and equitable food distribution system.
